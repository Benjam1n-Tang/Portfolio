              Benjamin Tang is a senior at Stony Brook University majoring in
              Computer Science, currently based in New York City. His passion
              for technology began in high school, where he was drawn to the
              hands-on nature of computing, problem-solving, and iterative
              learning. Over the course of his academic journey, he has
              developed a strong foundation in software development and
              continues to expand his technical skill set. With a focus on
              building efficient, user-centered applications, he is eager to
              apply his knowledge and showcase his capabilities as a
              developer.{" "}

              Benjaminâ€™s experience as a Python tutor for the non-profit BigSib
              Organization, which he co-founded with his peers, alongside his
              internship at the Selective Corporate Internship Program (SCIP),
              has contributed significantly to his growth as a developer. These
              roles have strengthened his ability to communicate effectively,
              collaborate within teams, and adapt to different learning
              environments. Through SCIP, he gained valuable exposure to
              industry practices and real-world applications of technology in a
              professional setting. He looks forward to further opportunities to
              apply his skills and continue developing as a software
              engineer.{" "}
